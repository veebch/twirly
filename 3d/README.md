# Gears and Case

These stl files were made with [openSCAD](https://openscad.org/) and Freecad. The script that generated the stl files is also here in case you need to tweak things due to using different parts. The gears script was based on was written by @chrisspen (https://github.com/chrisspen/gears)

To regenerate the two gears, use openscad to render the gear (uncomment ringgear or wormgear) which you can then import into your CAD tool of choice (+1 for [FreeCAD](https://freecad.org)) for tweaks to the design.
